Project Description:
We are an aspiring kitchen appliance company wanting to get into the market and want to analyze what type of appliance is currently selling the best and what factors allow you to be competitive in the market.
To do so we want to see which category is the best selling on Amazon and what factors influence their high sales such as review ratings, prices, etc.
We will then determine the top 10 brands that sell that category and compare them to every other brand.


Questions:
What type of kitchen appliance sells the most on Amazon?
What are the best selling brands for that appliance?
What factors (such as review count or box price) affect the amount of revenue a brand makes?
How can we use these factors to enter the market and maintain competitiveness?
