Project Description:

Using an Amazon Dataset about various products, we will ask how certain variables affect units sold and monthly revenue. 
We will answer questions about what kinds of appliances sell the most and what influences the sales of the objects such as review ratings, brand, and more. 
We will work together in Jupyterlab and github to publish our findings 
We will create visualizations using matplotlib and Pandas to organize our data 
Weâ€™ll write a word doc to answer questions and analyze data
